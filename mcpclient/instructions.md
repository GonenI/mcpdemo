## Terminal Command Guidelines

### PowerShell-specific Reminders
- When working in PowerShell, use semicolons (`;`) instead of ampersands (`&&`) to chain commands
- Example: `cd path\to\directory; dotnet run` instead of `cd path\to\directory && dotnet run`
- PowerShell uses semicolons as command separators rather than the ampersands used in bash/cmd

### Other Helpful Reminders
- the current system is running on Windows and PowerShell
